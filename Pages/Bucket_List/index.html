        Hello there! I'm Nathan, a computer science and physics student at Colorado School of Mines. I'm currently pursuing a M.S. + B.S. in Computer Science, and a B.S. in Engineering Physics, expected graduation in May 2025.

        I'm the president of the Mines Robotics Club, an organization with over 10 concurrent robotics projects. It has been wonderful to give students the opportunity to learn and practice robotics, and grow the robotics community on campus.

        Outside of school, I'm also a triahtlete, a speedcuber, and a chess enthusiast. The challenge of each these endeavors continue to fuel my passion for these activities, in a somewhat cyclic manner.
